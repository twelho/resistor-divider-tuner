# Resistor Divider Tuner

A simple resistor divider calculator for tuning LDO voltage regulator output voltages using common resistor values. Minimizes target voltage error as first optimization priority, and lowest total current through the resistor divider as the second priority (in case of ties).

This has been successfully used to optimize the output voltage a [TPS7A90](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps7a90.pdf).
